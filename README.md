This is a library for arbitrary dates.

Most programming languages have pretty good support for the Gregorian calendar.
That doesn't help me much when I'm trying to write a book that doesn't use
the Gregorian calendar.

This will eventually be rolled in to the rest of my book-writing software.

If you're doing any programming where you need to handle non-gregorian dates,
this library may well work for you.

WARNING: Doesn't respect relativity. Sci-fi may not work here.
